Purpose of Coding Standards
Coding standards are incredibly important for coding. They help not only with the clarity of the code, but also to set a basic framework for you to code around. Without coding standards everyone would develop their own system that would in essence be their own coding standard. Then, when we tried to collaborate, no one would be able to read each other’s code because not only is it in a different standard, but you also have no guarantee that the other persons standard is anything like your standard. This results in lengthening the amount of time it would take to communicate what the code actually did.

Class Standards
Our in class coding standards are non-intrusive, and overall just help to clarify our code for reading. This is similar to how we learn to construct paragraphs in our native language. You don’t just throw a bunch of terms together even if they got the point across because of how unclear such a system would be. Just as with our code, even if it gets the job done, it needs to do so in a clean, and concise manor so as to not waste the time of the person reading the code.
