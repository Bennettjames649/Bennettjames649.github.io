As someone coming from C and C++, javascript is a language that is interesting to use. You don’t have to worry about variable data types, and this makes it very easy to write up a simple but working code. However, I can say that I don’t really enjoy not having to deal with data types, simply because they sometimes helped keep track of what could go where by checking type. If you were completely new to programming however, it would be a very easy language to start off with as there is very little you actually need to know aside from how to actually code javascript. Also, the absence of data types seems to lend itself to the fact that the language as a whole can be written fairly quickly when compared to other languages. Without having to worry about types, you simply give inputs and outputs of variables and functions to variables and they are able to hold them.

The introductory WODs were helpful in learning the language, but overall it just comes down to being familiar enough with javascript, and that depends entirely on the amount of time you are willing to put in.  It is for this reason that the WODs are so helpful, they make sure you keep dealing with javascript on a day to day basis, rather than once in a blue moon. It is for this reason that I think I will enjoy “athletic software engineering” as the hardest part for me is putting in time every day, rather than having larger binge learning sessions. While I have a few thoughts on the language from my perspective, I don’t think I’m familiar enough with the language to give an accurate telling of whether or not it is a good language for software engineering. On one hand, it is easy to pick up and start with, but on the other, without types it seems like it is just waiting for something to go wrong. No matter what however, I am excited to learn more of the ins and outs of javascript and how to best apply my previous language knowledge to the problems Javascript will present.
