Video games have always been directly dependent on computer science and software engineering. Not only do they require a working system to play, but they also push the boundaries of computer science forward. I want to learn how to use software engineering to create and understand how some of my favorite games work. From why a particular data type was used, to understanding the implementation of collision, video games are rich ground for exploring computer science in its entirety.

In the future I would like to either create, or help create games of any kind. This will require skills such as teamwork, cooperation, and perhaps most importantly, knowledge of computer science. I wish to be able to explain to someone exactly why I used something as opposed to a different implementation. This requires me to be extremely knowledgeable in computer science, but also means that I will have to know the merits of different implementations. 

Eventually I want to explore the development process of video games in a project. Taking a game from an idea to a working implementation would be enjoyable, educational, as well as help to tell me if I would even enjoy working as a game developer. It is easy to sit and dream about working as a game designer, but for all I know I would actually hate the work. A small scale game project would allow me to dip my feet in the water and find out if I would really enjoy game development.
