Currently my most important ongoing project is getting my B.A. in Information and Computer Sciences from the University of Hawaii at Manoa. After switching from the biochemistry program I had my work cut out to try and catch up in the ICS program. Having to start at the bottom again was disheartening as I had to work my way back up a degree path. That being said, I have always been fascinated by computers, and this has helped me in progressing my studies.

Through the ICS program I have much about computer science from abstract data types, to running C and Java code in the same program. The full range from theoretical to hands on has been covered. Everything to do with coding is not the limit of the scope of the degree. The analysis of algorithms as well as the mathematical understanding of the theories is equally important.
  
Each class I take further prepares me to get a job after I get my degree with full confidence that I will be an expert in my field. While being a Jagex developer is a childhood dream of mine, I will need significantly more training before I will be ready to do something so intensive. Not only finishing my degree, but also just accumulating some working experience to actually know how to approach different projects.
